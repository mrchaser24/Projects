                        <h3>Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a passion for inquiry that eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and immigrated to the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with his work also having a major impact on the development of atomic energy. With a focus on unified field theory during his later years, Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.</h3>

                    <h1>Here is some information about Einstein's life:</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Albert Einstein was born 14 March 1879.</li>
                        <li>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.</li>
                        <li>He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</li>
                        <li>He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</li>
                        <li>He lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, except for one year in Prague, and he received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900. He taught theoretical physics there between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin.</li>
                        <li>Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".</li>
